# IPTracker

This is my attempt to making an IP tracker app. I used a GeoLoction API mixed with Leaflet, a javascript mapping library with Svelte.js


# Difficulties
One of the biggest problems I had was with Leaflet, there was an error in my code, that was throwing an error. After I say, 2 hours of debugging I found I shouldn't be using a reactive statement to a latitude and longitude value.


# Lastly

I'm thinking about expanding on this and have it also be a routing, like plot routes from say Shanghai to Beijing making use of the javascript web speech API later on.
